Take a look at this comment from my code reviewer and let me know what you think.

If you agree, please propose a fix immediately. You can also provide different options if you think there are better ways to address the issue.

If you do not agree, let me know why.

Sometimes I add my own commentary after sharing the reviewer's comment. Watch out for those, usually in bullets with "-" preceding.
